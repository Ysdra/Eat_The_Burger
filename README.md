## App Description:
This is a node.js application deployed on a Heroku web server that allows users to eat, delete, create their own burgers, and save those burgers either to the "Have Not Been Devoured" or 
"Have Been Devoured" list. 

## Methodology:
This node.js app relies on 3 key node packages: Express, Handlebars, and MySQL. Utilizing these 3 main node dependencies, we are able to emulate the MVC architecture by following the main tenets of a CRUD based application.
This is accomplished by a custom built ORM.
